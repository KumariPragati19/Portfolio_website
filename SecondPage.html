                <li> The currency converter application, called Currency Converter, converts amounts from one currency to two others. You can choose to display three different currencies, euros, yen, or dollars, and enter a value in one currency to be converted into the other selected currencies.</li>

            <li> The history of the Snake game goes back to the 1970's. However, it was the 1980's when the game took on the look that we will be using. It was sold under numerous names and many platforms but probably gained widespread recognition when it was shipped as standard on Nokia mobile phones in the late 1990's.
                The game involves controlling a single block or snakehead by turning only left or right by ninety degrees until you manage to eat food. When you get the food, the Snake grows an extra block or body segment.   
                If, or rather when, the snake bumps into the edge of the screen or accidentally eats himself the game is over. The more food the snake eats the higher the score.</li>

        <b>WASHING MACHINE</b>

            <li>  Washing machines are a common feature today in the household. The most important utility a customer can derive from a washing machine is that he saves the effort he/she had to put in brushing, agitating and washing the cloth. 
                Most of the people wouldnâ€™t have noticed (but can reason out very well) that different type of cloth needs different amount of washing time which depends directly on the type of dirt, amount of dirt, cloth quality etc. 
                Here i use fuzzy logic in my this project.When one uses a washing machine, the person generally selects the length of wash time based on the amount of clothes he/she wish to wash, and the type and degree of dirt cloths have. To automate this process, we use sensors to detect these parameters (i.e., volume of clothes, degree and type of dirt). 
                The wash time is then determined from this data.
